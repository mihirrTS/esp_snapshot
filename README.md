    <i>Your React e-ink Display</i>
</p>
<hr />

Warka is a framework for building e-ink displays using React as a frontend and Python as a backend.

An ESP32, running a ~100 C++ lines lightweight software, is used to fetch a screenshot file from the backend server and display it in the e-ink display.

Warka has 3 components:

1. Frontend that is displayed in the e-ink paper, coded in React
2. Backend server, coded in Python (Flask) that:
   - Serves the endpoints used by the frontend
   - Screenshots the frontend and stores it in a bmp file to be retrieved by the ESP32
   - Serves a config file to the ESP32 (to dynamically control screen refresh rate, etc.)
3. An ESP32 that fetches the bmp screenshot file from the backend server and displays it in the e-paper, coded in C++.

With this architecture, you can now iterate super fast on your display and draw anything really quickly.

No need to hardcode your icons in C++ anymore. No need to worry about the size of your text.

The design burden is now on the frontend (React) side. You can implement a dashbaord, a calendar, a news feed, a dynamic weather display, a screensaver... Up to your imagination!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Backend
-  **Download ChromeDriver:**
    - Visit [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)
    - Download ChromeDriver for your system
    - Extract to `backend/chromedriver/chromedriver`
    - Verify: `./backend/chromedriver/chromedriver --version`
- **Backend Configuration:**
    - Edit `backend/config.py`:

    ```python
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_api_key_here"
    ```

- **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python server.py
   ```
   Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend
- **Set up the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## ESP32
- Edit `esp32/src/config.h`
```c++
// WiFi Configuration
#define WIFI_SSID "<YOUR_WIFI_SSID>"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "<YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD>"

// Server Configuration
#define BASE_URL "http://192.168.1.79:8000/" // change this with your backend server address
```
- Flash the code into your ESP32

## Hardware
The hardware is very simple. You need:
- ESP32: I used [this one](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005704190069.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.10.56ee5e5bnYfjPc&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- E-INK display: I used the [GooDisplay 7.5 inch](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005002870223620.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.15.56ee5e5bvOrIsx&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- E-INK adapter: I used the [GooDisplay adapter](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004633084221.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.14.56ee5e5bvOrIsx&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- power supply: I used my laptop as a power supply but you can also use a power bank or a 5V power supply
- a few jumper wires to connect the ESP32 to the E-INK display

### Wiring

Here is how to wire the ESP32 to the E-INK display:

| ESP32 Pin     | E-INK Pin |
|---------------|-----------|
| GND           | GND       |
| 3.3V          | 3.3V (VCC)|
| GPIO D4       | Busy      |
| GPIO D16      | RES       |
| GPIO D17      | D/C       |
| GPIO D5       | CS        |
| GPIO D18      | SCK       |
| GPIO D23      | SDI       |

### Demo
This is the main dashboard of Warka. It displays the date, the weather forecast, the stock market, the current top hacker news posts and an overview of your portfolio.

But you can also easily display any image.

## üîå ESP32 Integration

The dashboard is designed to work with ESP32 microcontrollers:

1. **Image Fetching**: ESP32 requests screenshot data via `/image` endpoint
2. **Chunked Transfer**: Data sent in manageable chunks for memory constraints
3. **BMP Format**: 1-bit monochrome images optimized for e-ink displays
4. **Configuration**: ESP32 settings served via `/config` backend endpoint
5. **Low Power**: Designed for battery-powered operation

### Real-time Updates

- Stock prices: Updated every 5 minutes
- News feed: Updated every 15 minutes
- Weather: Updated every 30 minutes
- Holdings: Updated every 5 minutes

### E-ink Display Optimization

- Fixed 800x480 resolution layout
- High contrast black and white design
- Optimized for readability on e-ink screens
- Automated screenshot functionality

### Data Visualization

- Stock price changes with percentage indicators
- Weather icons and temperature ranges
- Portfolio allocation percentages
- News engagement metrics

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
- Check that port 8000 is available
- Verify OpenWeatherMap API key is valid

**Frontend not loading data:**
- Confirm backend is running on port 8000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding

**Screenshot functionality not working:**
- Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and executable
- Check Chrome/Chromium is installed on system
- Verify frontend URL is accessible from backend

**Stock data not loading:**
- Yahoo Finance API may have rate limits
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify ticker symbols are valid
